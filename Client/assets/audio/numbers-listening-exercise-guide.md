# Numbers Listening Exercise Audio Guide

## Audio File: `numbers-listening-exercise.mp3`

This audio file is used for the Numbers Listening Activity (Activity 8 of 9) in the Counting lesson.

## Content Structure

The audio should contain **10 Swahili numbers (1-10)** read clearly with pauses between each number.

**Users will write the numbers as digits (1, 2, 3, etc.), not as Swahili words.**

### Recording Script

Record the following numbers with a 2-3 second pause between each:

1. **moja** (one) - User writes: **1**
2. **mbili** (two) - User writes: **2**
3. **tatu** (three) - User writes: **3**
4. **nne** (four) - User writes: **4**
5. **tano** (five) - User writes: **5**
6. **sita** (six) - User writes: **6**
7. **saba** (seven) - User writes: **7**
8. **nane** (eight) - User writes: **8**
9. **tisa** (nine) - User writes: **9**
10. **kumi** (ten) - User writes: **10**

## Recording Guidelines

1. **Pace**: Speak at a moderate, conversational pace
2. **Clarity**: Pronounce each number clearly and distinctly
3. **Pauses**: Leave 2-3 seconds between each number
4. **Intro**: Optional brief intro like "Listen carefully and write down the numbers you hear" in English or Swahili
5. **Tone**: Use a friendly, encouraging tone
