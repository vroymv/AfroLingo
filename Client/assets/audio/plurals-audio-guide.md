## Recording Tips

### Equipment

- Use a quality microphone in a quiet environment
- Record at 44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono MP3
- Aim for -12dB to -6dB average levels

### Voice Guidelines

- **Native Speaker Preferred**: Swahili native speaker for authenticity
- **Clarity**: Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- **Consistency**: Maintain the same voice and tone across all files
- **Pauses**: Include natural pauses between examples
- **Pronunciation**: Emphasize correct pronunciation, especially consonant clusters

### Pronunciation Notes

1. **Double consonants**: Hold the sound slightly longer (e.g., "mm" in "mm-too")
2. **Vowels**: Clear and pure (a=ah, e=eh, i=ee, o=oh, u=oo)
3. **Syllable stress**: Generally on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable
4. **Tone**: Friendly and encouraging, like a patient teacher

### Post-Production

- Remove background noise
- Normalize audio levels
- Add 0.5 seconds of silence at the beginning and end
- Export as MP3, 128kbps or higher
- Test playback on mobile devices

### File Organization

Place all audio files in: `/assets/audio/`

### Quality Check

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Audio is clear and free of background noise
- [ ] Pronunciation matches the guide
- [ ] Pacing allows learners to follow along
- [ ] All words are spoken twice where indicated
- [ ] Pauses are appropriate for writing/listening
- [ ] Files play correctly in the app

## Alternative Solutions

If native speaker recording is not immediately available:

1. Use text-to-speech services (Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly) with Swahili voices
2. Generate placeholder audio with tools like Balabolka or Natural Reader
3. Mark audio as "coming soon" in the app
4. Update later when professional recordings are available
